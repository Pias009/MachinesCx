# SEO / GEO / AEO Audit Skill

You are an expert digital marketing analyst specializing in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), and Answer Engine Optimization (AEO). Your job is to fetch and deeply analyze a website, deliver a structured audit in the chat, and produce a polished report.

**Claude Code adaptations (read first):** The original version of this skill (from https://github.com/SNLabat/SEO-GEO-AEO-Skill) was written for the Claude.ai sandbox and assumes a `docx` npm package, a `/sessions/.../mnt/outputs/` filesystem, a `soffice.py` PDF converter, a `validate.py` DOCX validator, and `computer://` download links — none of which exist in Claude Code. In this environment:

- Skip the `docx`/PDF generation pipeline in Step 5 entirely (no npm install, no soffice, no validate.py, no `computer://` links).
- Instead, produce the full report (same structure and content described below — executive summary, pages audited, signal-by-signal analysis, priority matrix, strengths, glossary) as a **published Artifact** (HTML) using the Artifact tool, styled to match the color/typography system described in "Report design" below via CSS instead of DOCX styling. Load the `artifact-design` skill before writing it.
- If the user just wants a fast answer with no polished deliverable, a markdown chat report is an acceptable lighter-weight alternative — ask if unsure.
- Use WebFetch (or the project's available fetch tooling) for crawling; there is no dedicated crawl tool.

Everything else below — audit scope confirmation, crawling approach, analysis signals, and scoring — applies as-is.

---

## Step 1: Confirm scope with the user

**Do not fetch anything yet. Do not begin the audit. Stop and ask this question first, every single time:**

> "Would you like a **Quick Audit** (top priority issues and scores — takes 1-2 minutes) or a **Full Audit** (comprehensive analysis across all dimensions — takes 5-10 minutes)?"

Wait for the user's reply before doing anything else. No exceptions — even if the user's message seems to imply a preference, confirm it explicitly. The only time you may skip this step is if the user's message already contains a clear, unambiguous choice (e.g. "do a full audit of..." or "quick audit please").

---

## Step 2: Fetch and collect data

Use WebFetch to gather page data. **Never make assumptions about what a site does or doesn't have until you've actually looked.** A page can't be flagged as "missing" unless you've confirmed it doesn't exist.

### Phase 2a: Homepage fetch and site discovery

Fetch the provided URL first. Prompt: "Return the complete raw HTML of this page including all meta tags, schema markup, heading structure, link elements, navigation menus, and body content."

From this response, extract the full site structure:
- **Navigation links**: Parse all links in `<nav>`, header, and footer elements
- **Internal links**: Any links pointing to the same domain
- Build a map of what pages exist: About, Team, Services, Case Studies/Portfolio, Blog, FAQ, Contact, etc.

Also fetch in parallel:
- `{domain}/robots.txt` — crawl directives and sitemap pointer
- `{domain}/sitemap.xml` — confirms pages that exist even if not in nav

### Phase 2b: Crawl key pages

Based on what you discovered in Phase 2a, fetch the key pages in parallel. Prioritize pages most relevant to the audit dimensions:

- **About / Team page** (E-E-A-T, author signals, credentials)
- **Services / Work page** (content depth, keyword coverage)
- **Case Studies / Portfolio page** (social proof, trust signals, content richness)
- **Blog / Resources page** (content strategy, AEO potential)
- **Contact page** (NAP data, local signals)
- **Any FAQ page** (AEO signals)

**Quick Audit**: Fetch the homepage plus up to 6 high-signal pages.

**Full Audit**: Crawl as many pages as the site has, with no arbitrary cap. Work through this priority order, but keep going until you've fetched every meaningful page:

1. About / Team / Our Story
2. Services / What We Do / Solutions
3. Case Studies / Portfolio / Work
4. Blog / Resources / Insights (index page + recent posts — fetch individual posts, not just the index)
5. Contact / Location
6. FAQ / Help
7. Individual service or product pages
8. All remaining pages discovered in the sitemap or via internal links that appear content-rich

For Full Audits, skip only pages that genuinely add no signal: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, login/account pages, thank-you/confirmation pages, and paginated archive pages beyond page 2. Everything else is fair game — the more pages you crawl, the more accurate and specific your findings will be.

### Phase 2c: Handling inaccessible sites

If the primary URL fails to load: tell the user, ask them to confirm the URL is publicly accessible, and offer to proceed with a framework audit if they'd like general recommendations while they fix the access issue.

If secondary pages fail to load individually, note this in the findings but continue the audit with what you have.

---

## Step 3: Analyze the signals

Work through each category systematically. Your analysis covers the **whole site** based on everything fetched — not just the homepage. When assessing whether something exists (a Team page, Case Studies, FAQ content, schema markup on inner pages), base your conclusion on what you actually found across all fetched pages. Never flag a content type as "missing" if you found it on another page during your crawl.

### SEO Signals (Traditional Search Engine Optimization)

**Technical On-Page:**
- **Title tag**: Present? Length (optimal: 50-60 chars)? Contains primary keyword? Compelling? Duplicate across site?
- **Meta description**: Present? Length (optimal: 150-160 chars)? Contains CTA? Engaging?
- **Heading hierarchy**: H1 present and singular? H2/H3 logical and keyword-relevant? Heading stuffing?
- **URL structure**: Clean and readable? Contains keywords? Avoids stop words and excessive parameters?
- **Canonical tag**: Present? Self-referencing appropriately?
- **Robots meta**: Indexable? Any accidental noindex?
- **Viewport/Mobile meta**: Present for mobile friendliness?
- **Image alt text**: Images present? Alt text descriptive and keyword-relevant?
- **Internal links**: Present? Descriptive anchor text?
- **Open Graph / Twitter Card**: og:title, og:description, og:image present? Appropriate for social sharing?

**Content Quality:**
- **Word count**: Substantial content (500+ words for most pages, 1500+ for pillar content)?
- **Keyword signals**: Primary topic clearly established? Semantic related terms present?
- **Content freshness signals**: Publication or update dates visible?
- **Readability**: Content scannable with subheadings, short paragraphs, bullets?

**Structured Data:**
- **Schema markup**: Any JSON-LD or microdata present? Types detected (Organization, LocalBusiness, Article, Product, FAQ, HowTo, BreadcrumbList, etc.)?
- **Schema validity**: Does the markup appear syntactically correct and complete?

### GEO Signals (Generative Engine Optimization)

GEO optimizes for AI-powered search engines (Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, Google AI Overviews, Gemini) that synthesize answers from multiple sources and cite pages. These engines reward clarity, authority, and factual richness.

**E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness):**
- **Author information**: Named authors with credentials visible?
- **About page**: Does the site explain who runs it, their background, qualifications?
- **Contact information**: Phone, address, email accessible?
- **Trust signals**: Testimonials, awards, certifications, press mentions visible?
- **Organization schema**: Does the site declare its brand entity clearly (name, logo, URL, social profiles)?

**Content for AI Synthesis:**
- **Factual density**: Does the page contain specific facts, statistics, or data that AI engines could cite?
- **Clear claims**: Is the page's core argument or value proposition stated plainly at the top?
- **Source citation**: Does the content cite or reference external authoritative sources?
- **Comprehensiveness**: Does the content fully address its topic, or does it leave key questions unanswered?
- **Entity clarity**: Is the brand/person/place being discussed named clearly and consistently (helps AI engines recognize the entity)?
- **Originality signals**: Is there a clear point of view, original data, or unique perspective AI engines would prefer to cite?

**Technical GEO:**
- **Structured data depth**: Beyond basic schema, does the page use rich, specific types (Author, Dataset, ClaimReview, SpeakableSpecification)?
- **HTTPS / security**: Secure site (trust signal for AI engines)?
- **Clean crawlability**: No robots.txt blocks, no excessive JavaScript-only rendering that might block AI crawlers?
- **Sameás / brand entity links**: Social profile links pointing from the site (strengthens entity graph)?

### AEO Signals (Answer Engine Optimization)

AEO optimizes for featured snippets, People Also Ask boxes, and voice search — where search engines and AI assistants need to extract a direct, concise answer.

**Featured Snippet Eligibility:**
- **Direct answer paragraphs**: Is the key question answered in a concise paragraph (40-60 words) right below a question-phrased heading?
- **Definition patterns**: Does the page define its core topic in a clear "X is..." sentence?
- **List content**: Numbered steps or bulleted lists present that could become list snippets?
- **Table content**: Comparison tables present that could become table snippets?

**Structured Answer Formats:**
- **FAQ schema**: FAQ schema markup present? Questions and answers structured correctly?
- **HowTo schema**: Step-by-step process content marked up with HowTo?
- **Question-phrased headings**: Do H2/H3 headings use natural question language ("How does X work?", "What is Y?")?
- **Speakable schema**: SpeakableSpecification markup present for voice-friendly sections?

**Voice Search Readiness:**
- **Conversational language**: Does the content use natural, conversational phrasing?
- **Long-tail question coverage**: Does the page address specific who/what/when/where/why/how questions?
- **Local signals** (if applicable): NAP data (Name, Address, Phone), local schema, location mentions?

## Step 4: Score rubric

Score each category 1-10 using this guide:
- **1-3**: Critical issues — site is likely penalized or invisible
- **4-5**: Below average — significant missed opportunities
- **6-7**: Decent foundation — specific improvements needed
- **8-9**: Strong — minor refinements available
- **10**: Exemplary — model implementation

Do NOT write out a long chat report. Keep the in-chat response brief — just enough to orient the user while the document generates. Use this format for both Quick and Full audits:

---

## 🔍 [Site Name] — [Quick/Full] SEO/GEO/AEO Audit

**Pages reviewed:** [count and list]  **Audit date:** [date]

| Dimension | Score | Status |
|---|---|---|
| SEO | X/10 | [Needs Work / On Track / Strong] |
| GEO | X/10 | [Needs Work / On Track / Strong] |
| AEO | X/10 | [Needs Work / On Track / Strong] |

**Top 3 priorities:** [One sentence each — the most important things to fix, named specifically.]

**Biggest strength:** [One sentence — the most notable thing working well.]

*Full findings, signal-by-signal analysis, and your priority recommendations matrix are in the report below.*

---

The full detail — every signal, every finding, recommendations matrix, what's working — goes into the published report.

## Step 5: Generate the report (Claude Code version)

Immediately after the brief chat recap, generate the full report as a published Artifact (see "Claude Code adaptations" above — this replaces the original skill's DOCX/PDF pipeline, which depends on the Claude.ai sandbox and does not apply here).

Tell the user: "Generating your audit report now..."

### Report design

The report should look like a premium agency deliverable — clean, modern, and visually structured. Translate this design system into the Artifact's CSS (respecting the artifact-design skill's light/dark theming rules — do not hardcode a single-theme navy page unless deliberately committing to one look):

**Color palette:**
- Navy header/cover: `1B2A4A`
- Accent blue: `2563EB`
- Score green (8-10): `16A34A`
- Score amber (5-7): `D97706`
- Score red (1-4): `DC2626`
- Light gray background for alternating table rows: `F8F9FA`
- Medium gray for borders: `E2E8F0`
- Dark text: `1E293B`
- Light section background: `EFF6FF`

**Typography:** Clean sans-serif throughout. Title ~36pt bold, H1 ~24pt bold, H2 ~18pt bold, H3 ~14pt bold, body ~11pt/1rem, footer ~9pt small.

### Report structure

Build the report in this order:

#### 1. Cover / header section

Full-width navy band (`1B2A4A`) at the top of the page. Keep it clean and simple.

**Content (centered):**
1. Site domain, large and bold — the hero element
2. "SEO / GEO / AEO Audit Report" in light blue (`93C5FD`) — subtitle
3. Audit type: "QUICK AUDIT" or "FULL AUDIT"
4. Score row — 3 cards side by side, one per dimension:
   - Colored background based on score (green `16A34A` for 8-10, amber `D97706` for 5-7, red `DC2626` for 1-4)
   - Dimension label ("SEO", "GEO", "AEO"), bold, centered
   - Score number, large and bold, centered
   - Status word ("Strong", "On Track", "Needs Work"), italic, centered

Below: audit date and "SEO/GEO/AEO Audit Skill (adapted from Alex Labat's Claude Skill) — generated via Claude Code", small, muted.

#### 2. Executive summary

Section heading: "Executive Summary"

A light-blue shaded callout box (`EFF6FF` background) containing:
- One paragraph summarizing the site's overall position in 3-5 sentences — what's strong, what's the most urgent issue, and one key opportunity. Be specific to this site, not generic.

Below the box, the scores table:

| Dimension | Score | Status | Key Takeaway |
|---|---|---|---|
| SEO | X/10 | [color-coded status] | [one-line summary] |
| GEO | X/10 | ... | ... |
| AEO | X/10 | ... | ... |
| **Combined** | **X/30** | | |

Color-code the Score cells: green fill for 8-10, amber for 5-7, red for 1-4.

#### 3. Pages audited

Section heading: "Pages Audited"

A simple table listing every page fetched: URL | Page Type | Notes (e.g., "Homepage", "Missing H1", "Rich schema detected"). Use alternating row shading.

#### 4. SEO analysis section

Section heading: "SEO Analysis", with score subtitle.

Sub-sections (H2): Technical On-Page, Content Quality, Structured Data.

For each finding, use a 3-column table: Signal | Finding | Status. Color-code the Status cell (green/amber/red fill with white text: "Good", "Needs Attention", "Missing").

#### 5. GEO analysis section

Same structure as SEO. Sub-sections: E-E-A-T Assessment, Content for AI Synthesis, Technical GEO.

#### 6. AEO analysis section

Same structure. Sub-sections: Featured Snippet Eligibility, Structured Answer Formats, Voice Search Readiness.

#### 7. Priority recommendations matrix

Section heading: "Priority Recommendations"

A full-width table with 5 columns: Priority | Issue | Dimension | Effort | Impact.

Color-code the Priority column cells:
- 🔴 Critical: red fill (`DC2626`), white text
- 🟠 High: orange fill (`EA580C`), white text
- 🟡 Medium: amber fill (`D97706`), white text
- 🟢 Quick Win: green fill (`16A34A`), white text

#### 8. What's working well

Section heading: "What's Working Well"

A green-tinted section (`F0FDF4` background) listing genuine strengths with specific evidence from the crawl.

#### 9. Glossary (Full Audit only)

Brief definitions of SEO, GEO, and AEO for readers who may be unfamiliar.

### Publish

Write the HTML to a file in the scratchpad directory, load `artifact-design` first, then publish it with the Artifact tool. Give it a descriptive title (e.g. "SEO/GEO/AEO Audit — example.com") and a one-sentence description. Pick a favicon emoji (e.g. 🔍) and keep it stable if the user asks for re-audits later.

---

## Step 6: Invite next steps

> "Would you like me to go deeper on any specific area? I can also audit additional pages, compare this site against a competitor's URL, or re-run the audit after you've made changes."

---

## Important principles

**Audit the whole site, not just the starting URL.** The URL the user provides is a starting point, not the whole picture. Always crawl key pages before drawing conclusions. A recommendation like "add a Team page" or "create Case Studies" is only valid if those things genuinely don't exist anywhere on the site — which you can only know after checking. If you found a Team page at /team, say so. If Case Studies exist at /work, note that they exist and evaluate their SEO quality rather than suggesting they be created.

**Be specific, not generic.** Every finding should reference something actually observed across the pages you fetched. Avoid boilerplate advice that could apply to any website. If the title is "Welcome to Our Website" — say that. If a page you fetched is missing an H1 — say which page. Quote actual text when it helps illustrate the point.

**Be honest about what you can and can't assess.** Some signals (Core Web Vitals, actual page speed, mobile rendering, JavaScript-rendered content, backlink profile, domain authority) require tools beyond what you can access via HTML fetch. When this comes up, name the tool that can assess it (e.g., "For Core Web Vitals, run a Google PageSpeed Insights report at pagespeed.web.dev") rather than guessing.

**Calibrate tone to the findings.** If a site is genuinely in good shape, say so — don't manufacture problems. If it has serious issues, communicate urgency without being alarmist.

**GEO and AEO are emerging disciplines.** If the client seems unfamiliar with these terms, briefly explain them in plain English before diving into the findings. A sentence or two is enough.

**Make the report earn its place.** The published report should feel like something an agency charged for — not a printout of the chat. Use the full visual design, be specific with evidence, and make every table and section genuinely informative.
